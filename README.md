- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pasinsiri
- 👀 I’m a data analyst in a FinTech startup company, I'm currently working in both investment and non-investment sides.
- 📈 For the investment side, I helped the investment team to create two portfolios, the first one used the Black-Litterman allocation that combines historical return and experts' views on each asset class, the other one used the Machine Learning algorithm to pick the expectedly outperform funds in the next 6 months in each category, e.g. technology stocks, healthcare stocks. Now I'm co-working with the investment team in the quantitative investing part.
- 💻 For the non-investment side, I'm working with several teams in order to help them meet their business goals, e.g. the marketing team where I gather data from the company's social media like YouTube and Facebook and analyze the data in order to deliver useful insights and recommendations.
- ✍️ I'm also a writer, and I've been writing articles about cryptocurrencies, which is one of my interested domains, since last year. You can follow my personal Medium blog at https://pasinsiri.medium.com or the FINNOMENA's website at https://www.finnomena.com/author/codebreaker
- 📫 Lastly, if you'd like to talk with me, you can reach me at pasin.sirirat@gmail.com

Nice to meet you all! Hope everything goes well.
